# Random username generator
## Why would I want a random username?
Usernames give out information about you which can put kids at risk or lead to identity theft. See the post from @ThinkUKnow_Aus

## Privacy
The wordlist is loaded from the website and the username is generated in your browser. I do not record the username you generate. You can review the source code or contribute at github.com/gitstua/random-username/
